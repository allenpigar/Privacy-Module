You should be aware that our “lawful basis” for processing personal data about you may be impacted by the legal requirements in the country in which you reside. As such, outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we may at times rely on consent to process personal data about you, whereas within the EEA we will seldom rely on consent as the lawful basis for processing personal data about you, except as indicated below.</p>\n<p>Your information may be transferred to another country for processing. Consistent with our Policy, we will seek consent for the transfer or rely on another lawful basis if that is required under applicable law with respect to that transfer. Those other bases may include: where the relevant regulator has determined that the country to which the data will be transferred provides an adequate level or legal protection for personal data, where an approved legal mechanism is in place to affect such transfers, or where you have provided your consent. For any transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S., we take additional steps in line with applicable data protection legislation. We have put in place adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of your privacy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of your rights; e.g., when we transfer data from the EEA to the U.S. we use European Commission approved standard contract clauses to provide appropriate protections.</p>\n<p>You may also raise a concern or lodge a complaint with a data protection authority or other official with jurisdiction. This usually means the data protection authority in the country where you are habitually resident, where you work, or where the alleged infringement took place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changestothispolicy\">Changes to this Policy</h2>\n<p>We update this Policy when necessary in response to changes in our data collection or processing practices or policies, changes to our products or services, or other changes to our business practices.
